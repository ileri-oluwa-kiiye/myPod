        <p>
            Welcome to the place to show off your iPod, wherever you
            might be. Wanna join the fun? All you need is any iPod, 
            from the early classic iPod to the latest iPod Nano, the
            smallest iPod shuffle to the largest iPod Video, and a 
            digital camera. Just take a snapshot of your iPod in your 
            favorite location and we'll be glad to post it on myPod.
            So, what are you waiting for?
        </p>

            Here are some iPod photos around Birmingham. We've 
            obviously got some passionate folks over here who love 
            their iPods. Check out the classic red British telephone
            box!
